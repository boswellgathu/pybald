The Pybald console
------------------

The pybald console allows you to interact with your program using the python REPL.

The console automatically loads the route mapping for your application as well as all of the controllers and models for your project. The console allows you to interact with your application directly, experiment with new functionality, play with models, and test and exercise the application.

It also includes a command history per-project.
